# Small-Projects-Python
Compilation of personal Python projects I have worked on

This repository contains the smaller, simpler projects that I have worked on 

These are independent, personal projects, and are not affiliated with the University of Maryland. The project implementations are mine, and all 
code is written by me, using knowledge obtained by the University of Maryland and independent studies
